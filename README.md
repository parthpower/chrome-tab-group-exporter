## Why this isn't on ChromeWeb Store?

Maybe will publish it there if need be.

## Are you actually using this?

Yes! I needed something quick to store my chrome sessions and move those around without creating accounts and what not. UX/UI aren't the best, App logic isn't the most optimized or even good from any point. Why? Because I just needed something done ASAP, can fix things later if need be.
